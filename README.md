**CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**  is a technology for managing all your company‚Äôs relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships to grow your business. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
